I am a first-year MS student at the [School of Software, Beihang University (BUAA)](http://soft.buaa.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Lu Sheng](https://lucassheng.github.io/).

Currently, my interest lies in **Embodied Agents**, which are at the intersection of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Embodied AI, with particular interests in high-level planning and low-level control with spatio-temporal intelligence, working towards an generalist agent in a complex real-world environment.


<!-- I also successively haved intern at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) advised by Pro. [Shao Jing](), [Galbot](https://www.galbot.com/) and [BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/). -->


<!-- I am grateful to all my collaborators and mentors along the way. I first started doing research under the guidance of Prof. Miao Wang. Then I started working on deep learning related projects under the supervision of Prof. Lu Sheng. Besides, I also successively haved intern at MiniMax, Shanghai AI Lab, and VAST, and I'm fortunate to have worked closely with Junting Dong, Yuan-Chen Guo and Yanpei Cao.


. I am also working closely with [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/).

Before I joined BUAA in 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher (2017-2019) in [MMLab@CUHK](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). I received my Ph.D. from [Department of Electronic Engineering](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/) at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), advised by [Prof. King Ngi Ngan](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~knngan/) (IEEE Life Fellow).




My research interest is broadly in Robotics and 3D Computer Vision, with particular interests in generalizable object perception, understanding and manipulation currently. My research objective is to build an intelligent agent with the robust and generalizable ability to perceive and interact with a complex real-world environment. Representative works are highlighted. -->
